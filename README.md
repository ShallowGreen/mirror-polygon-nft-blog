# Blog Publishing Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn to develop a full stack application using [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) as the storage layer and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as the smart contract protocol. We will provide a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that you will complete by leveraging [ether.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) and [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). In the process, you'll dive into key concepts relevant to Web 3 and expand your understanding for what it takes to build decentralized applications (dApps).

## ü§î What is Mirror?

[Mirror](mirror.xyz) is a powerful blog publishing platform native to Web 3. It allows authors to own their posts and leverage the economic rails of crypto to earn value from readers. It also continues to grow as a ecosystem for creators that is more powerful than any publishing platform before it. In a way, Mirror is the first killer dApp of Web 3.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting started
If you know how to program and have [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) experience, you'll be able to complete the tutorial. Having said that, you'll be more comfortable if you have some experience with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Moreover, while you may not have built full stack Web 3 applications before, hopefully you have used a crypto wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and you're familiar with basic blockchain concepts like public address, private keys, and signing transactions.

If any of that sounds unfamiliar, or the idea of engaging with those concepts sounds daunting at this point in your learning, we recommend starting with the [Solana Wallet](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/solana-wallet-intro) tutorial before completing this one.

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed. Make sure you've setup [SSH or token-based authentication](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/) for Github. Then clone the repo and run the yarn command to install the app dependencies:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:figment-networks/web3-evm-template.git
$ cd web3-evm-template
$ yarn
```

If you into any Node issues, make sure you're running version 14.17.0 or greater. You can use the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you need to manage multiple Node versions locally.

Now that you have the template, you need to navigate to this tutorial's branch:

```bash
$ git checkout mirror-clone
```
